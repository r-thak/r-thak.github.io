  <p>Hi, I'm Rohan Thakkar! I study Computer Science and Philosophy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, though I previously attended UW-Madison and miss it dearly. My interests include platform/hardware-aware performance optimizations, applications of malware development in the context of gaming, improving education through well-designed educational policy, and AI safety research. This website is still in it's infancy, I'll be giving it the attention it deserves over winter break.</p>

Hi, I'm Rohan Thakkar! I study Computer Science and Philosophy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, though I previously attended UW-Madison and miss it dearly. My interests include platform/hardware-aware performance optimizations, applications of malware development in the context of gaming, improving education through well-designed educational policy, and AI safety research.

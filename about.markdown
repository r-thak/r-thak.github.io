# About Me

I'm Rohan Thakkar, a Computer Science and Philosophy student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Class of 2028). I'm passionate about systems programming, AI research, and improving education.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm conducting undergraduate research with Dr. Frederic Sala, focusing on LLM distillation techniques for drone control. This work involves developing training environments using the Aerial Gym Simulator and verifying program correctness using Dafny.

I'm also interested in low-level systems, having worked on projects ranging from Minecraft anti-cheat systems to wireless connectivity solutions for medical devices.

## Education & Experience

I've held positions including:
- **Undergraduate Researcher** at UIUC
- **Peer Tutor** for Intro to Computer Engineering at UW-Madison
- **Technical Support & Development** at PAWS Chicago (implemented LLM-driven support systems)
- **Engineer Intern** at Caterpillar

## Philosophy

I believe in maximizing the value of education—not just through formal coursework, but through unofficial auditing, self-directed learning, and sharing knowledge with others. This philosophy extends to my blog, where I write course reviews and thoughts on educational policy.

I'm also a strong advocate for:
- Practical, hands-on learning
- Interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving
- Making technical knowledge accessible
- Using technology to improve systems and processes

## Projects

Some of my notable projects include:
- **3Docs** (MadHacks 2025 1st Place) - Interactive 3D guides from repair manuals
- **LLM Self-Service Support** - AI-driven helpdesk system
- **Minecraft Anti-Cheat Systems** - Detecting unusual behavior and packets
- **Song to FL Studio** - Audio decomposition and project file generation

## Get in Touch

I'm always happy to discuss:
- Research opportunities
- Course advice (especially for UW-Madison or UIUC students)
- Project collaborations
- Education policy and reform

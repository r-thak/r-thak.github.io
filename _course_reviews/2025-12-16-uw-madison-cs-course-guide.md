As a student who likes to get the most bang for their buck, I've found that one way I can get more learning from paid tuition is to unofficially audit courses (simply put, asking the professors of interesting courses if I can sit/participate in their course without enrolling). Another measure I've taken to maximize tuition is extensively planning future course schedules, and this research and planning has helped me assist others in their own course planning, and I'm hoping to provide more insight to others through this post as well.

## Preface

I have not officially taken many courses at UW-Madison, so it would be ill-advised not to question my perspective. Also, I highly recommend understanding your own goals and desires, as this provides a reason to plan courses. Some larger goals to consider include:

- How difficult do you want your current course load to be?
- How insulated do you hope to be from gaps in knowledge in future coursework? Putting more immediate effort in can help to spread difficulty across semesters.
- What do you want to do after graduation? Grad schools want to see certain trends.
- Can you take courses relevant to future job interviews or even your future job?
- How much/what do you actually hope to learn? Do you enjoy learning CS?

## Specific Course Insights

### CS200 – Programming 1

I did not have to take this course since I had credit from AP CSA. However, I would avoid this course at UW-Madison. I have found it difficult to provide students in this course with support, since students are only allowed to use resources learned in class. Want to use `Collections.sort()`? Tough luck, that's cheating and your work will be voided and potentially reported, since the assumption used is that you have no coding knowledge.

### CS/MATH 240 - Intro Discrete Math

Take the CS version in the Fall, unless you have a light schedule, time to burn, and a desire to do better in CS577 and proof-based courses in general. I took an equivalent course at a community college and found material to be similar to the CS 240 section I sat in on, but I cannot speak to the rigor of the homeworks or exams. Taking a philosophy logic course will allow for a lot of overlap while completing humanities credits which is nice, especially if you're not into more abstract humanities.

### CS300 – Programming 2

Massive load of work, and it makes you a better programmer even if you've been an at home programmer previously. The only way to improve is practice, and programming is no exception. This is the most time intensive course I've taken at UW-Madison so far, so factor this into your plan accordingly. I would avoid taking an equivalent course at a less rigorous institution, as you will be inadequately prepared for CS400 and the gaps in knowledge and intuitions will bite you later. Take with Hobbes if possible, lectures are engaging.

### CS400 – Programming 3

Easier than 300, especially for those who have experience programming at home. Concepts include a slew of technologies you can encounter in the real world, such as Git, the command line, Linux, and RDP. Of course, theoretical DSA concepts are also covered, though they're not terribly difficult. The most difficult concept in the course is Red Black Trees, and this is near the beginning of the course as a continuation of CS300's trees. Learn RBT and its implementation early if possible!

### CS252 – Intro Comp Eng

This is the only course I've dropped, and this was due to the format, instructor (it was his second to last semester before retiring), and frustrations with finding support. I cannot provide unbiased advice, but I recommend looking at my biased yet positive review of ECE252 (an equivalent course) below.

### ECE252 – Intro Comp Eng

This is the most fun and interesting course I've taken at UW-Madison! The course is flipped-classroom format, and as such, you are able to effectively take notes from concise videos which are made by the best in the department. Flipped-classroom format also lends itself to socialization and learning the material through teaching, which I found to be incredibly fun and helpful. I took this course with Prof Setareh Behroozi, and since she is the professor who most often teaches this course, I would recommend taking her section if possible. The most common gripe with Prof Behroozi is that though she is engaged and kind in class, she does not respond to email.

### CS/ECE 352 – Digital Subsystem Fundamentals

As a course taught by the ECE department, the class format is flipped classroom, videos are available online. I've watched all of the videos and might take the course in the future as a gen-ed, as the material is interesting and Prof Behroozi also teaches this course. Course is about the same difficulty as ECE252.

### CS/ECE 354 – Intro Machine Organization

Heavier course load, somewhere near CS300. Experience in C programming will make this much easier, since pointers are a major source of friction for inexperienced students. Will update after completion.

### CS425 – Combinatorial Optimization

I will be taking this course if possible. Probably one of the better applications courses if you're hoping to avoid filler work that isn't relevant to industry. Will update after completion.

### CS518 – Wearable Technology

If this course is offered during a semester you can take it, I envy you. I have not taken this course since it has not been offered yet (planned but cancelled Fall 2025), but the subject is so awesome and if you enjoy fabric arts, the course involves sewing. I've also connected with the professors for the course and participated in a course instructed by CS518's Textiles instructor (Prof Fairbanks) which was super fun.

### CS537 – Operating Systems

I am so excited to take this course it's not even funny. OSTEP textbook is legendary, and although the Arpaci-Dusseau's no longer teach the course, lecture videos are available online. Current professors are also awesome, Mike Swift and Anthony Sauer are active on Piazza and Shivaram Venkataraman is one of the CS department GOATs, if you want to pursue Honors or Grad school he's a great advisor. Conceptual material isn't disproportionately difficult, though the actual programming assignments can break you. Other than OSTEP textbook homework, you can also do the OSTEP github projects to prepare. I wouldn't recommend this though, as the return on investment isn't great if you know C.

**Pros:** Useful concepts for real world, makes you a better programmer, knowledge for interviews
**Cons:** Massive workload, not fun if you don't like the material, other instructors are hit or miss

### CS540 – Intro AI

Take this in the Spring, as Prof Fred Sala runs the course during the Spring as opposed to Young Wu who writes devious exams with little way to prepare other than just increasing your IQ. Rigor is higher than MadGrades will lead you to believe, but still manageable. Multivariable Calculus (Calc 3) will serve you well in this course, as much of the material from the course guide involved both linear algebra as well as multivariable differentiation (gradient descent is fueled by a loss/cost function of many variables). I will not be taking this course as I am not interested in much of the material, and online courses are supposedly better than UW-Madison's AI course offerings.

### CS544 – Intro Big Data Systems

Can be an Honors course option, and has useful material, especially for answering those "When you Google something, what happens" questions. Will update upon completion.

### CS557 – Parallel & Throughput-Optimized Programming

Since this course is so new, there isn't much consensus about it, but I'd imagine that there are wrinkles to be ironed out. However, this may end up being one of the more useful courses offered at UW-Madison if the syllabus is to be trusted, and I'd imagine this was proposed as a way to make students more competitive to employers (Big Tech seems to be plateauing with hiring while HFT companies seem to be slightly growing). Will update after taking.

### CS559 – Computer Graphics

One of the better applications courses, with rigor being on par with CS540 yet with much more creative freedom and real-world applicability.

### CS570 & CS571

CS570 is not my cup of tea, especially 570, since the course is the boring part of 571 on steroids (terminology & theoretical concepts not based in fact) without any programming (the course uses Figma).

CS571 – Building UI: By far the best bang for your buck applications course, as any student looking to work with frontend development will learn truly useful concepts and apply their skills to project work which can be used for portfolios. Project-based course means you might also underestimate the workload due to the high average GPA. I will not take this course as I did not enjoy sitting in lecture, nor does frontend development interest me.

## Electives I'm Avoiding and Why

**CS506 – Software Engineering:** Bad format, poorly rated instructor (taught by the only professor I've emailed who wasn't chill with unofficial auditing), too easy for the wrong reasons, and better options exist – I won't share the secret sauce but there is a much better course with near-identical material.

**CS 525 – Linear Optimization:** Decent course, but the sequential and more applicable course (526 – Adv Linear Programming) doesn't seem to be offered anymore.

## Non-CS Insights

### Understanding MadGrades

MadGrades is only as useful as you are wise. Make sure you understand why certain GPA outcomes might be the way they are; self selection plays a massive role in average course GPA. Easy factors to look at are variables such as:

- Is this course a major requirement? Students who don't enjoy a topic will tank GPA.
- How many students have taken this course? Less students often means students who are more confident and dedicated to certain skills/topics raise the average GPA.
- Which major/department is this course most closely related to?
- What prerequisites precede this course?

### Math Courses

Avoid Math 320 (Linear Algebra + Differential Equations in one course) if you are not an engineering student; The course is poorly structured, difficult to follow, and material is not covered in necessary depth. If you must choose between Math 320, 340, 341, 345 and 375, I strongly recommend taking 341 (Proof-based Lin Alg), as it will create a strong foundation before taking CS577, though if this is not possible, 340 is the next best. The other three are not intro courses for most, and 375 (+ 376) is quite difficult and time consuming, so it would be inadvisable to take these courses unless you either A) are a Math major/interested in Math or B) have a light course load and are up for a challenge and are willing to take a hit to your GPA.

### Gen Ed Experiences

Gen Eds are a major part of your education which can really bite you in the rear if you are not careful. Here has been my experience:

**German 267 – Yiddish Song and the Jewish Experience** bent me over and gave me its AB (A-). The final exam switched from online to in person, so the grading switched to favor exams over papers. The relevant understanding to take from this is that it is in your best interest to research your classes prior to the drop deadline.

**Genetics 133 – Genetics in the News** did exactly what a gen ed should do. Having an understanding of genetics allows for the ability to take courses such as Genetics 375 – Special Topics (Quantitative Methods in Genetics) when there is an application of computer science/programming in Genetics.

**Philos 241 – Intro Ethics** is quite a good Gen Ed. I sat in nearly every lecture for this course offered by Prof Landau in Fall 2024, and he was awesome. Philosophy is such an awesome field, and most philosophy instructors are some of the most amazing teachers who will leave lasting impacts on your perspective and character.

**Biochem 104 – Molecules to Life** is a course I have not taken but have participated in, and it is too easy in my opinion.

### General Gen Ed Tips

- Special Topics courses often are the most interesting and applicable to the real world
- Philosophy courses share these traits with special topics courses
- Easy gen eds can be difficult if the source of rigor is from memorization volume
- Gen eds are more than just fluff, there is a reason many Pure CS students end up having difficulty passing interviews or connecting with others

## Online Resources

I recommend:

- **3Blue1Brown**, specifically, Essence of Linear Algebra
- **Stanford's CS109 Lectures** — Probabilities and Statistics for CS with Chris Piech
- **Berkeley's Math 115 Lectures** — Number Theory with Richard E Borcherds

## Other Tuition-Maxxing Advice

I've reduced cost of tuition as an out of state student by concurrently enrolling at a community college (brought down Spring 2025 tuition from 28k to 14k for me, 6 credits at UW and 12 at CLC). However, there are downsides:

- Financial Aid & Scholarships get muddy if you are a part time student
- Graduate School admissions might not be favorable to this approach
- Non-UW grades do not count towards GPA
- Attending in-person tests can be a challenge
- Rigor differences mean prerequisite knowledge may be weak
- Less fun, fewer opportunities to meet others
